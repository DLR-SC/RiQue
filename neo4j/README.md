# Json Data to Neo4j Database

* This notebook reads the json file and convert to neo4j database. This is just for testing purpose so user can convert sentences into neo4j queries without need of Hololens/AR. However, when this repository is integrated with Hololens/AR then user does have to run this file as it is managed by Hololens/AR itself.
